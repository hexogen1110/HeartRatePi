  * GUI:  
  Using **tkinter** module, Python's build-in standard GUI package. Additional PIL package for Image & ImageTk.  
```
sudo pip3 install pillow
```

  * BLE:  
  **Bluez** module is requied for **gatttool** and **bluetoothctl**.  

```
sudo apt-get install bluez
```
  bluetoothctl is used to issue a bluetooth controller power cycle before every connection, just in case.

  * Manipuilate BLE with **pexpect**:  
> - Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. 
> - Pexpect works like Don Libesâ€™ Expect Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands.

  * Test mode:  
  Run with parameter x for demo without an actual BLE device for development.
